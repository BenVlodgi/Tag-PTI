* This project includes five new palette items unique to TAG, the Paint Fields and blue mounted auto portal.
* Co-op mode supports one player with a portal gun, and the other with a paint gun.
* A custom pre-compiler enables paint in every map, adds paint fizzlers in all portal fizzlers, strips away the portagun from one of the coop bots and switches any instance that end with "_sp" to instances that end with "_coop" when compiling a coop map.
