* This PTI Modification is built off of the BEEMOD. Available here http://portal2backstock.com/bee
* A few small updates from the BEE2 were included in this mod. Avaiable here http://portal2backstock.com/bee2
* This project includes five new palette items unique to TAG, the Paint Fields and blue mounted auto portal.
* Co-op mode supports one player with a portal gun, and the other with a paint gun.
* A custom pre-compiler enables paint in every map, adds paint fizzlers in all portal fizzlers, strips away the portagun from one of the coop bots and switches any instance that end with "_sp" to instances that end with "_coop" when compiling a coop map
